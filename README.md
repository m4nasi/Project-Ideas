Key:

✨ - Favourite ideas

🎇 - Project is in progress

🎆 - Needs more research into the idea

🎈 - Have done this project

# Ideas:

### News Research Bot

When you want to get a quick news update and don't want to dive deep into the web a bot that posts PDF articles of the most trending articles and features would be perfect.

→  Create a program that searches particular news outlets and twitter to see what's trending

Edit: Have done a twitter bot, needs to be finished

### Amazon Price Tracker

There are open source trackers available for Price Tracking Amazon products in which you can plot prices; minimum prices of a product, maximum prices of the product. This can be helpful to see how the prices of a product fluctuate in time.

→  Create a program that goes through the open source trackers and possibly plot a graph on products

### Automated Personal Finance App

An app that tracks expenditure and saves the finances made. There are loads of apps that do this but a personal finance app that can track money coming in and out automatically and be saved onto your local device.

→  Create a GUI first and then the logic and then possibly save it as a csv or a plain text file

### ✨ Time Management App

Pomodoro Technique app to focus on work. There would be a stopwatch and after a certain period of time (most likely 25 mins) sends an alert. And then allow for a 5 min break. 

→  Create a GUI and then implement and maybe store the amount of times someone has used it - hours and minutes in the last week and then month

### Dynamic Polling App

An app that allows people to take in poll results in real time. The program would allow users to express their opinions on a topic and then share the results. Perhaps on a video call when people want to collect data from their audience.

### Binary to Decimal Convertor

This takes in and converts a binary input to a decimal number. Would be quite interesting to see how many bits you can go up to. 

### Countdown Timer

An event countdown timer that notifications, maybe might be better as a calendar with other reminders.

### ✨Notes App

An online note pad that stores markdown notes to do a note dump of all the random notes stored on a laptop.

### Bit Masks

Say if certain images were forbidden to be shared. This program would take in a image and changing the meta data so it is the same as another image bitwise and therefore be able to be shared as on a bit level it is the same as other pictures.

### Emoji Translator App

Just a fun idea of translating sentences into emojis, like the Google keyboard perhaps search an emoji by typing it.

### Flashcard App

An app that reviews and tests your knowledge through Flashcards, somewhat like Quizlet. The project would have a GUI and would be able to separate flash cards and maybe do mind maps. Could integrate the timer project idea?

### Github Timeline

The program generates a timeline of a users Github repository through the week, month and years. Would be cool to see how different users have done through out the years. 

### Podcast Library

A website that has a library of your favourite podcasts and sends you a notification when the newest version is out and possibly add comments to the podcasts to indicate which part you liked.

# Quick Projects

#### Finding Pi to the Nth digit

Someone enters a number and have the program generate Pi up to as many decimal places. Would have to see how far it could go.

#### Finding e to the Nth digit

Someone enters a number and have the program generate e up to as many decimal places. Same as Pi would see how far it goes.

#### Fibonacci Sequence

Enters a number and the program creates the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the nth number. 

#### Prime Factorisation

Finds all the prime factors if it has any and displays them. Displays if it is a prime number perhaps?

#### 🎈Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass and more)

Someone enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to and then the value. Such as Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Edit: I have done the Celsius to Fahrenheit project.

#### Alarm Clock

A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time.

#### ✨ Distance Between Two Cities

Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. Perhaps could make it so you could like the differences between 2 cities in 2 different countries.

#### Complex Number Algebra

Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. 

#### Closest pair problem

The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry: given *n* points in metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them.

#### Eulerian Path

Create a program which will take as an input a graph and output either a Eulerian path or a Eulerian cycle, or state that it is not possible. A Eulerian Path starts at one node and traverses every edge of a graph through every node and finishes at another node. A Eulerian cycle is a Eulerian Path that starts and finishes at the same node.

#### ✨ Text Editor

Notepad style application that can open, edit, and save text documents. Might go with the notedump project.

#### Quote Tracker

A program which can go out and check the current value of stocks for a list of symbols entered by the user. The user can set how often the stocks are checked. For CLI, show whether the stock has moved up or down. 

#### Guestbook / Journal

A simple application that allows people to add comments or write journal entries. It can allow comments or not and timestamps for all entries. 

#### Bandwidth Monitor

A small utility program that tracks how much data you have uploaded and downloaded from the net during the course of your current online session

#### Country from IP Lookup

Enter an IP address and find the country that IP is registered in. 

#### Page Scraper

Create an application which connects to a site and pulls out all links, or images, and saves them to a list.

#### Online White Board

Create an application which allows you to draw pictures, write notes and use various colours to flesh out ideas for projects.

#### Get Atomic Time from Internet Clock

This program will get the true atomic time from an atomic time clock on the Internet. Use any one of the atomic clocks returned by a simple Google search.

#### 🎈 Fetch Current Weather

Get the current weather for a given zip/postal code.

Edit: I have done a weather program but only displays one area and their weather - may change so user can submit their own.

#### Create Zip File Maker

The user enters various files from different directories and the program zips them up into a zip file.

#### ✨PDF Generator

An application which can read in a text file, html file or some other file and generates a PDF file out of it. Great for a web based service where the user uploads the file and the program returns a PDF of the file. 

#### Code Snippet Manager

Another utility program that allows coders to put in functions, classes or other titbits to save for use later. Organized by the type of snippet or language the coder can quickly look up code.

#### Budget Tracker

Write an application that keeps track of a household’s budget. The user can add expenses, income, and recurring costs to find out how much they are saving or losing over a period of time.

#### TV Show Tracker

Make an application which can search various online TV Guide sites, locate the shows/times/channels and add them to a database application. The database/website then can send you email reminders that a show is about to start and which channel it will be on.

#### Travel Planner System

Make a system that allows users to put together their own little travel itinerary and keep track of the airline / hotel arrangements, points of interest, budget and schedule.

#### Watermarking Application

Have some pictures you want copyright protected? Add your own logo or text lightly across the background so that no one can simply steal your graphics off your site. Make a program that will add this watermark to the picture.
