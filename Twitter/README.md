# Twitter API
This is a Python program which sends and receive tweetsand in this project I used the Python module Twython to get tweets and then send out random tweets such as text and images.

For this project you need:
 - twython Python module
 - Python 3 

In this project I applied for a Twitter developers account through www.developer.twitter.com

I created an app using the developers platform and created a Consumer API key, Consumer API secret key, Access token, and Access token secret. 
*Don't share these with anyone!* 

I saved the API keys in a Python file and named it auth.py - I haven't added these to the repository.

This program can also send random tweets from an array and could also post images if included, it is currently commented.
